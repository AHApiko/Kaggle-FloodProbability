# Kaggle-FloodProbability
This is my contribution to the Kaggle playground competition "Regression with a Flood Prediction Dataset." This code placed me 1060th out of 2794 participants. I will try to explain the reasoning behind my approach and the choices I made. I know that it might not be the best approach, as proved by my ranking, but as I always say in all my projects, the main goal is to learn, better results will come in time with enough hard work and practice.

As a final note in this brief introduction, I would like to thank ALDPARIS for sharing how he achieved the top score (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e5/discussion/50). I learned a valuable lesson from his insights: working smart is better than working hard.
